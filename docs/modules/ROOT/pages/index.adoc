== 3. Install iOS Wallet SDK

=== A). Installing iOS Wallet SDK using https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage[Carthage]

==== i). Installing https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage[Carthage]

Get https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage[Carthage] by running the following command on terminal

____
brew install carthage
____

You can also choose https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage/#installing-carthage[other methods] to install https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage[Carthage]

==== ii). Downloading Wallet SDK using Carthage

Carthage looks at a file called `Cartfile` to determine which libraries to install.
Create a file in the same directory as your Xcode project called `Cartfile` and enter the following to tell Carthage which dependencies we want:

Add following entry in your `Cartfile`

____
github "ostdotcom/ost-wallet-sdk-ios"
____

Now to actually install everything run the following in your terminal:

____
carthage update --platform iOS
____

A `Cartfile.resolved` file and a `Carthage` directory will appear in the same directory where your `.xcodeproj` or `.xcworkspace` is.

==== iii). Copying the `OstWalletSdk.framework` file in your Xcode project

Open your project in Xcode, click on the project file in the left section of the screen and scroll down to the `Linked Frameworks and Libraries` section in Xcode.

`Carthage` folder will have the `.framework` files that we will add in Xcode project.

Now open the `Carthage/Build/iOS` folder in Finder:

Run this command

____
open Carthage/Build/iOS
____

Open application target, under General tab, drag the built `OstWalletSdk.framework` binary from `Carthage/Build/iOS` folder into Linked Frameworks and Libraries section.

image::/platform/docs/sdk/assets/copy-framework-file.png[copy-framework-file]

==== iv). Adding the `OstWalletSdk` dependencies in your Xcode project

We need to add the `.framework` files of dependencies present inside `Carthage/Build/iOS`.

Open `application targets` in Xcode.
Under `Build Phases` click `+` icon and choose `New Run Script Phase`.
Add the following command.

____
/usr/local/bin/carthage copy-frameworks
____

Click the `+` under `Input Files` and add the following entry framework:

$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/FMDB.framework
$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/SipHash.framework
$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/TrustKit.framework
$(SRCROOT)/Carthage/Build/iOS/OstWalletSdk.framework
----

{blank} + image:/platform/docs/sdk/assets/add-dependency-framework-files.png[copy-framework-file]

==== v). Adding SDK configuration file

Create `OstWalletSdk.plist` file.
This file has configuration attributes used by OstWalletSdk.
You should copy paste the configuration values from below snippet.

Copy paste this configuration file

----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
 <!DOCTYPE plist PUBLIC "-//Apple//DTD PLIST 1.0//EN" "http://www.apple.com/DTDs/PropertyList-1.0.dtd">
 <plist version="1.0">
 <dict>
    <key>BlockGenerationTime</key>
    <integer>3</integer>
    <key>PricePointTokenSymbol</key>
    <string>OST</string>
    <key>PricePointCurrencySymbol</key>
    <string>USD</string>
    <key>RequestTimeoutDuration</key>
    <integer>30</integer>
    <key>PinMaxRetryCount</key>
    <integer>3</integer>
    <key>SessionBufferTime</key>
    <integer>3600</integer>
    <key>UseSeedPassword</key>
	<false/>
 </dict>
 </plist>
----

|===
| Attribute | Description

| BlockGenerationTime
| The time in seconds it takes to mine a block on auxiliary chain.

| PricePointTokenSymbol
| This is the symbol of base currency.
So its value will be OST.

| PricePointCurrencySymbol
| It is the symbol of quote currency used in price conversion.

| RequestTimeoutDuration
| Request timeout in seconds for https calls made by ostWalletSdk.

| PinMaxRetryCount
| Maximum retry count to get the wallet Pin from user.

| SessionBufferTime
| Buffer expiration time for session keys in seconds.
Default value is 3600 seconds.

| UseSeedPassword
| The seed password is salt to PBKDF2 used to generate seed from the mnemonic.
When UseSeedPassword set to true, different deterministic salts are used for different keys.
|===

:::warning These configurations are MANDATORY for successful operation.
Failing to set them will significantly impact usage.
:::

==== vi). Add `NSFaceIDUsageDescription` description in `info.plist`

The iOS Wallet SDK can use FaceID in lieu of fingerprint if the hardware supports it.
To support faceID, please include  https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/nsfaceidusagedescription[NSFaceIDUsageDescription] key in your application's `info.plist` file and describe its usage.

*Note: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/information_property_list/nsfaceidusagedescription[NSFaceIDUsageDescription] key is supported in iOS 11 and later.*

== 4. Initialize the Wallet SDK

SDK initialization should happen before calling any other `workflow`.
To initialize the SDK, we need to call `init` workflow of Wallet SDK.
It initializes all the required instances and run db migrations.

Recommended location to call *OstWalletSdk.initialize()* is in https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiapplicationdelegate/1622921-application[application] method of https://developer.apple.com/documentation/uikit/uiapplicationdelegate[UIApplicationDelegate].

[source,swift]
----
func application(_ application: UIApplication,
                didFinishLaunchingWithOptions launchOptions: [UIApplication.LaunchOptionsKey: Any]?) -> Bool {
    do {
        try OstWalletSdk.init(apiEndPoint: <OST_PLATFORM_API_ENDPOINT>)
     } catch let ostError {
           // Handle error here
     }
     return true
}
----

*OST_PLATFORM_API_ENDPOINT*: This will be the base API URL we need to provide to SDK while initializing.

*Sandbox environment endpoint*: "api.ost.com/testnet/v2"

*Production endpoint*: "api.ost.com/mainnet/v2"

== 5. Setting up communication between app and Wallet SDK

iOS Wallet SDK provides `workflows` that can be called by any controller class to perform wallet related actions.
Communication between app and Wallet SDK happens through callback functions.
We need to pass the callback functions in `workflows` provided by SDK.
The group of callback functions for communication between app and Wallet SDK is provided in `OstWorkflowDelegate` protocol.

image::/platform/docs/sdk/assets/communication-ios-sdk.png[walletSDKCommunication]

=== a). Implementing the `OstWorkflowDelegate` protocol

There are different ways to implement `OstWorkflowDelegate` and pass them while calling workflows.
We will create a dedicated class with name `OstWalletSdkInteract`.
This class will implement the `OstWorkflowDelegate` protocol.
We will use this class to create object that can be passed in SDK workflows as callback.

Sample Implementation of https://github.com/ostdotcom/ios-demo-app/blob/develop/TestDemoApp/OstSdkInteract/OstSdkInteract.swift[OstWalletSdkInteract class] is available as a part of https://github.com/ostdotcom/ios-demo-app/tree/develop[OST Wallet app].

[source,swift]
----
import Foundation
import OstWalletSdk
import MaterialComponents

class OstWalletSdkInteract: BaseModel, OstWorkFlowCallbackProtocol {

    extension OstWalletSdkInteract {

        func flowComplete(workflowContext: OstWorkflowContext, ostContextEntity: OstContextEntity) {

            var eventData:[String: Any] = [:];
            eventData["eventType"] = WorkflowEventType.flowComplete;
            eventData["workflowContext"] = workflowContext;
            eventData["ostContextEntity"] = ostContextEntity;
            self.fireEvent(eventData: eventData);
        }

        func flowInterrupted(workflowContext: OstWorkflowContext, error: OstError) {

            var eventData:[String: Any] = [:];
            eventData["eventType"] = WorkflowEventType.flowInterrupt;
            eventData["workflow"] = workflowContext.workflowType;
            eventData["workflowContext"] = workflowContext;
            eventData["ostError"] = error;
            self.fireEvent(eventData: eventData);
        }

        // more functions here
        .....

        .....

    }
----

=== b). Using `OstWalletSdkInteract` class

`OstWalletSdkInteract` can be used to create object that can be passed as callback in workflows.

Example

In the example below, we are calling `OstWalletSdk.addSession` workflow and passing object of `OstWalletSdkInteract` class

----

 var sdkInteract: OstWalletSdkInteract = {
    let interact = OstWalletSdkInteract();
    return interact;
  }()

   OstWalletSdk.addSession(
                    userId: currentUser.ostUserId!,
                    spendingLimit: self.spendingLimitTestField.text!,
                    expireAfter: Double(expireAfter),
                    delegate: self.sdkInteract)
----

== OST Wallet SDK APIs

=== Types of Methods

. `Workflows`: Workflows are the core functions provided by wallet SDK to do wallet related actions.
Workflows can be called directly by importing the SDK.
 ** Callbacks must confirm to `OstWorkflowDelegate` protocol.
The `OstWorkflowDelegate` protocol defines methods that allow application to interact with `OstWalletSdk`.
. `Getters`: The SDK provides getter methods that applications can use for various purposes.
These methods provide the application with data as available in the device's database.
These functions are synchronous and will return the value when requested.
. `JSON APIs`: Allows application to access OST Platform APIs.

== Workflows

=== setupDevice

This workflow needs `userId` and `tokenId` so `setupDevice` should be called when the application has determined that the user is logged in state.
Using the mapping between userId in OST Platform and your app user, you have access to `userId` and `tokenId`.

*If the user is logged in, then `setupDevice` should be called every time the app launches, this ensures that the current device is registered before communicating with OST Platform server.*

----
OstWalletSdk.setupDevice(
    userId: String,
    tokenId: String,
    delegate: OstWorkflowDelegate
)
----

|===
| Parameter | Description

| *userId* + *String*
| Unique identifier of the user stored in OST Platform

| *tokenId* + *String*
| Unique identifier of the token economy

| *delegate* + *OstWorkflowDelegate*
| An instance of a class that implements the callback function available in `OstWorkflowDelegate` protocol.
These callback functions are needed for communication between app and wallet SDK.
Implement `flowComplete` and `flowInterrupt` callback functions to get the workflow status.
Details about other callback function can be found in <<ostworkflowdelegate-protocol,OstWorkflowDelegate protocol reference>>.
+ This object should implement `registerDevice` callback function.
`registerDevice` will be called during the execution of this workflow.
|===

=== activateUser

It `authorizes` the registered device and activates the user.
User activation deploys TokenHolder and Device manager contracts on blockchain.
Session keys are also created and authorized during `activateUser` workflow.
So after `user activation`, users can perform wallet actions like executing transactions and reset pin.
`activateUser` needs to be executed once for a user in an economy.

----
OstWalletSdk.activateUser(
    userId: String,
    userPin: String,
    passphrasePrefix: String,
    spendingLimit: String,
    expireAfterInSecs: TimeInterval,
